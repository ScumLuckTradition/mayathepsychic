    <img src="Perspective-thing.jpg" alt="weird road thing" />
    <p>this peice was actually made for a <sup>perspective</sup> assignment in this class, uh, its probably the best use of color ive ever used color for so i am proud of myself more or less.</p>
    <p><strong><b>Note</b></strong>: I was listening to the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack when i was making this, so i have that soundtrack to owe for the atmosphere i tried to imply in this. </p>

    <h3>Heres a thing that im <span class="blue">WORKING</span> on</h3>
    <img src="BlackFlagTribute.jpg" alt="angry guy party" />
    <p>this is my black flag tribute beccause Black Flag is an amazing band, dude.</p>
    <p>and their influence on the punk genre of music is undeniable and i think they should be recognized for appealing to my angry 16 year old mind.</p>
