<p>this peice was actually made for a <sup>perspective</sup> assignment in this class, uh, its probably the best use of color ive ever used color for so i am proud of myself more or less.</p>
<p><strong><b>Note</b></strong>: I was listening to the Silent Hill 2 soundtrack when i was making this, so i have that soundtrack to owe for the atmosphere i tried to imply in this. </p>
